      <h1>A COAT by WILLIAM BUTLER YATES</h1>
      <br>
<p>
I made my song a coat<br>

Covered with embroideries<br>

Out of old mythologies <br>

From heel to throat;<br>

But the fools caught it,<br>

Wore it in the world’s eyes<br>

As though they’d wrought it.<br>

Song, let them take it<br>

For there’s more enterprise<br>

In walking naked.<br>
